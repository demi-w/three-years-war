To-do list:
Make a pause button (opens menu) -- properly integrated, see below
Properly integrate side butttons (should be their own pixi container, have proper pointerdown & up feedback, be redone so less pixelated)
Create displays for stats -- build, speed, etc. for each player
Create a UI element that says which player is currently playing
Create that tooltip thing -- informs you of which button you have selected, and what its associated cost will be
Cretae a lil arrow on the left which tells you which button you have pressed (and is current player's color ?? )
Create literally any animations, whoopsies
